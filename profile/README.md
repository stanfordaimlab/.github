# ü©∫ The AIM Lab
The Anesthesia Informatics and Media (AIM) Lab at Stanford University was founded in 2007 by Dr. Larry Chu, a practicing anesthesiologist and pioneer in the field of anesthesia informatics.

## üè• Our work
Our projects span education, clinical informatics, and mobile computing in medicine. No matter what we do, we aim to innovate user-centered solutions to healthcare IT. Our work has been honored by funding and awards from the National Institue of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality, IARS, Society for Technology in Anesthesia, and Medicine 2.0 among others. Over the last 20 years, the AIM lab has pioneered new approaches to inclusion of technology in anesthesia and medicine as a whole. Notable events include:

- In 2010, we were invited by President Obama to co-produce a design workshop at the Whitehouse to inform patient-centered future of the [AllOfUs](https://allofus.nih.gov) initiative at the NIH.
- We developed one of the first and most comprehensive electronic anesthesia learning platforms, [Learnly](https://learnly.org), which trained thousands of anesthesia residents at 20+ institutions in the United States.
- From 2011 to 2019, the AIM Lab hosted and produced [Stanford MedicineX](https://medicinex.stanford.edu), the world's largest conference devoted to design in healthcare. It focused on emerging technology in medicine, utilizing a unique patient-centered approach innovation, and served as one of the first examples of coproduction in a medical context.
- In 2016, with the department of medicine, we produced the award-winning series [Stanford 25](https://stanfordmedicine25.stanford.edu), a set of educational videos used to train physicians on the physical exam and bedside medicine.
- Starting in 2018, we have offered the [Stanford Anesthesia Summer Institute (SASI)](https://med.stanford.edu/anesthesia/education/SASI.html), a pre-college summer program focused on molding the next generation of compassionate leaders in medicine. This program has run continously since its founding.
- Since 2010, we have been one of the few organizations to offer a [Fellowship in Anesthesia Informatics](https://aim.stanford.edu/stanford-anesthesia-informatics-fellowship/).   
- Our machine learning research group was launched in 2023, focusing on developing patient-centered approaches to artificial intelligence. Projects in this domain have included evaluation of large language model's clinical calculation abilities, automatic assessment of a patient's ASA status, tailoring medical records to patient literacy, and exploring federated learning as solution to LLM hallucination.
- In 2024, we launched the [Stanford Technology in Healthcare Internship](https://med.stanford.edu/anesthesia/education/SASI/bridges-to-success1.html), an internship designed to introduce pre-medical students to research in medicine and technology.
